    We have a list of artists. For each one we can go to their site on spotify or see the list of albums they have. In the list of albums we can go to the album on spotify or we can see the list of songs by that album. In the list of songs, if there is a preview, we can play it, otherwise it cannot be played, and we can also go to spotify to listen to each song.
